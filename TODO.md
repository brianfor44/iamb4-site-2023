## Todo:
- Create component folder with things like nav, footer, etc. This needs special conventions to keep the folder from creating a route
- Figure out how to keep everything on the page and just scroll to the section
- Nav active states
- Error boundery via an error.tsx file? Also possibly add a not-found.tsx file for bad url handling.
